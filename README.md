# Instructions
Below, is where we are going to use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metrics.

 We will use some of the algorithms specifically:
- Linear Regression
- KNN
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
  
We will evaluate our models using:
- Accuracy Score
- Jaccard Index
- F1-Score
- LogLoss
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- R2-Score
  
Finally, you will use your models to generate the report at the end.
# About The Dataset
The original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/.

The dataset to be used has extra columns like 'RainToday' and our target is 'RainTomorrow', which was gathered from the Rattle at https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData

This dataset contains observations of weather metrics for each day from 2008 to 2017.
