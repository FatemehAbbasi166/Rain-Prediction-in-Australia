# Instructions
Below, is where we are going to use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metrics learned in the course.

We will use some of the algorithms specifically:
- Linear Regression
- KNN
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
  
We will evaluate our models using:
- Accuracy Score
- Jaccard Index
- F1-Score
- LogLoss
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- R2-Score
Finally, you will use your models to generate the report at the end.
